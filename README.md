# Project Overview

In this project I analyzed the Nigerian Presidential elections to observe trends and voter behaviour starting from 1999 when Nigeria returned to Civilian rule to 2019.
Elections are held every four years in the country so the analysis used data for the years 1999, 2003, 2007. 2011, 2015 and 2019.

# Data Sourcing and Cleaning

Election data from past Nigerian elections were obtained from Kaggle and loaded into power query in power bi. The dataset which comprised election data from 1999 t0  2019 was merged into one single dataset and column's with disjointed names renamed. The dataset was checked for datatype and other errors before being loaded into power bi.

# Analysis

The election analysis was presented in report format with the first report page summarizing key election figures such as the total number of voters obtained by state and total population by state. The total number of registered voters and total number of valid votes for each election year was obtained using the DAX Sum function and visualizations built to compare different parameters such as number of votes by states and number of votes obtained by each political party in a state. A line chart was used to observe the voting trend across the years and showed an upward trend for registered number of voters by election year and a downward trend in actual number of votes casted across the election years showing voter apathy. Key election swing states with high voter turnouts were also observed.

# Conclusion

The Northern states of Kano, Kaduna and Katsina as well as Lagos and Rivers were observed to be key election swing states owing to the high number of votes obtained from the states across the years. However, like other states, they also showed considerable voter apathy as while the number of registered voters increased in subsequent elections, number of actual votes actually decreased. 

Past election years also had two main political parties vying for the presidential slot even though Nigeria runs a multi-party system. The 2023 elections will however prove interesting as unlike the past when there were two major political parties; the ruling party  and main opposition party, a third party is in key contention for the top seat in 2023. It would be interesting to see which of APC, PDP and Labour Party will clinch the presidential seat.
